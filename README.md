# atomic
A unified full-stack web application framework in Haskell. 

Atomic:

* Is performance-oriented with server-side concurrency and client-side multitasking. 
* Uses a hierarchical MVC with services (HMVCS) approach for expressive UIs. 
* Permits server-side execution/rendering of UIs. 
* Has first-class, type-safe, composable websocket APIs and API implementations.
* Uses the same context abstractions (services, modules, etc...) on client and server; learn once, write anywhere.
* Uses and exposes a set of reactive-oriented programming primitives like signals, behaviors, promises and evented contexts.
* Implements *an extensible dynamically-typed hierarchy of views* a la [Marlow '06 (PDF)](http://simonmar.github.io/bib/papers/ext-exceptions.pdf).

*Documentation is OUT OF DATE as of the latest framework updates. Updates forthcoming.*

Documentation is under construction [here](https://grumply.gitbooks.io/atomic). 

A simple real-time chat application with a GitBook tutorial exists [here](https://github.com/grumply/atomic-chat) as a demonstration of the `atomic` fundamentals.
