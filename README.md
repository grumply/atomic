A unified full-stack web application framework in Haskell. 

Features:

* Performance-oriented
* Truly asynchronous and fair rendering and diffing
* MVC-style component views (asynchronous)
* React-style component views (locally and hierarchically synchronous; globally asynchronous)
* Extensible views a la [Marlow '06 (PDF)](http://simonmar.github.io/bib/papers/ext-exceptions.pdf)
* Pure views (basic HTML/SVG, keyed and unkeyed)
* Global services
* Cross-component/service/controller messaging
* Built-in Routing
* Reactive primitives
* Server rendering
* Typed and composable websocket APIs

## Version 0.6

* Per-component and per-controller asynchronous (fibered) diffing with deferred and batched application. 
* React-style components

## Version 0.5:

* Extensible views a la [Marlow '06 (PDF)](http://simonmar.github.io/bib/papers/ext-exceptions.pdf).

## Version 0.4:

* First-class, type-safe and composable websocket API specifications and implementations.
